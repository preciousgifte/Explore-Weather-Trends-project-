# Explore-Weather-Trends
# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree  - Project I
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
I wrote an SQL query to extract the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where I live from the database.
I created a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live(Port Harcourt).
I then plotted a correlation plot between Global and Port Harcourt average temperature
